# Yieldfolio
This is a quick exploration into NextJS with Material-UI & redux. The redux should be swapped out for the NextJS built-ins for population props and include testing.

### Goal
Show a user's positions in yield farming protocols in one convenient table. Users can manually enter emission rates or enter a yield-bearing token and its associated controller contract (TBA).

*Currently only mock API requests and hardcoded data.*


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn install
```

2. Run development server
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
